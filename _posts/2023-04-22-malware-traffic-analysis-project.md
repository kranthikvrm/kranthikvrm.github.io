<p>Hello everyone, I started pursuing my master's degree in cybersecurity at the University of Tampa in January 2023. In April 2023, I completed a project on malware traffic analysis. Despite having prior experience using Wireshark and conducting network traffic analysis, this project provided me with an opportunity to enhance my skills in network packet capture and traffic analysis. I learned how to identify unusual patterns, which helped me in detecting and analyzing a sophisticated Trojan attack originating from a Russian server. Please go through the below attached PDF report for a detailed analysis of my project.</p>
