# I participated in the UofTCTF 2024 I solved all forensics challenge,and this is my write-up for most forensics challenge and challenge of IoT
## Secret Message 1
![first one](Secret Message 1.png)

### it's pdf file so we open it we saw this 
![pdf](pdf.png)

```bash
pdftotext secret.pdf 
cat secret.txt |grep uof
```
flag: <mark>uoftctf{fired_for_leaking_secrets_in_a_pdf}</mark>

## Secret Message 2
![second](Secret Message 2.png)

### it's png so we open it we saw this 

![Alt text](image.png)

### so i searched how to fix the flag so found [this article](https://bishopfox.com/blog/unredacter-tool-never-pixelation) and [this tool](https://github.com/BishopFox/unredacter)  i replaced secret.png with challenge photo  i make him to try automatic to figure out the picture but it gave me wrong flag so my friend did it manually by Redact me and got the flag

## Illusion
![third](third.png)

### For this challenge we are given a packet capture file, upon inspecting traffic ive noticed a lot of http traffic coming to and from a rogue IP address 

![wireshark_image](wireshark_image.png)

### Once i viewed the streams of the packets ive noticed a weird *oldcss=* string and reported that to my teammates, a few hours later my teammate found some interesting github [trevorc2](https://github.com/trustedsec/trevorc2) so from [trevorc2_server.py](https://github.com/trustedsec/trevorc2/blob/master/trevorc2_server.py) I began dissecting its functionality and recognized that it was indeed following the correct trajectory. I comprehended its operational mechanisms and endeavored to decrypt the commands transmitted through the covert HTTP channel.

## EnableMe 
![enableme](enableme.png)

### we have docm file so i tried olevba on it 
```bash
olevba invoice.docm
```
### and i got this vba

```vba
Sub AutoOpen()
    Dim v6 As Variant, v7 As Variant
    v6 = Array(98, 120, 113, 99, 116, 99, 113, 108, 115, 39, 116, 111, 72, 113, 38, 123, 36, 34, 72, 116, 35, 121, 72, 101, 98, 121, 72, 116, 39, 115, 114, 72, 99, 39, 39, 39, 106)
    v7 = Array(44, 32, 51, 84, 43, 53, 48, 62, 68, 114, 38, 61, 17, 70, 121, 45, 112, 126, 26, 39, 21, 78, 21, 7, 6, 26, 127, 8, 89, 0, 1, 54, 26, 87, 16, 10, 84)

    Dim v8 As Integer: v8 = 23

    Dim v9 As String, v10 As String, v4 As String, i As Integer
    v9 = ""
    For i = 0 To UBound(v6)
        v9 = v9 & Chr(v6(i) Xor Asc(Mid(Chr(v8), (i Mod Len(Chr(v8))) + 1, 1)))
    Next i

    v10 = ""
    For i = 0 To UBound(v7)
        v10 = v10 & Chr(v7(i) Xor Asc(Mid(v9, (i Mod Len(v9)) + 1, 1)))
    Next i

    MsgBox v10
End Sub
```
so i convert it to python code and i run it 

```py
v6 = [98, 120, 113, 99, 116, 99, 113, 108, 115, 39, 116, 111, 72, 113, 38, 123, 36, 34, 72, 116, 35, 121, 72, 101, 98, 121, 72, 116, 39, 115, 114, 72, 99, 39, 39, 39, 106]
v7 = [44, 32, 51, 84, 43, 53, 48, 62, 68, 114, 38, 61, 17, 70, 121, 45, 112, 126, 26, 39, 21, 78, 21, 7, 6, 26, 127, 8, 89, 0, 1, 54, 26, 87, 16, 10, 84]

v8 = 23

v9 = ''.join(chr(v6[i] ^ ord(chr(v8)[i % len(chr(v8))])) for i in range(len(v6)))
v10 = ''.join(chr(v7[i] ^ ord(v9[i % len(v9)])) for i in range(len(v7)))
print(v9)
print(v10)

## Baby's First IoT Flag 4 (IoT)

![iot](iot.png)

### it's firmware.bin so we extract the content of it 
```bash
binwalk -extract --dd=".*" firmware1.bin
cd _firmware1.bin.extracted
```
### we saw many files but we know there is backdoor file so we try to grep it 
```bash
grep -r backdoor
```
![grep_result](backdoor.png)

### so we know have password let's get the flag 
```
 printf 'IoTBackDoor\n\0' | nc 35.225.17.48 4545
```
