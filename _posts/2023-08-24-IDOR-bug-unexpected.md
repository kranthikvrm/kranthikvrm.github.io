Hey, hi buddy! I'm Kranthi Kumar, and this is my very first blog post, so go easy on me if you find any mistakes. To start with, I completed my 10th grade in my village Kesavaram and got a seat at RGUKT Nuzvid for a 6-year integrated program covering 11th, 12th, and Engineering. I'm writing this post at the end of my first year at RGUKT. I've just started my journey here at RGUKT (IIIT Nuzvid), surrounded by new faces and big buildings, everything is fresh and exciting. I've made new friends and they are from different parts of the state, That's interesting! 

Before coming here, I was only familiar with my beloved "Godavari accent", but at RGUKT, I saw people speaking with various Telugu accents, which was quite surprising for me. Most students here come from rural backgrounds, just like me and it took me about 3-4 months to form strong bonds with these new friends.
 
One of the great things about RGUKT is that every student receives a laptop, they can use until graduation. pretty awesome, right? While I wasn't particularly excited about receiving a laptop from the college (since I already had one from my 10th grade), I could see the happiness on my fellow students faces ðŸ¤©. Now, about the education, We have online portals (Intranet) for notes and content for every chapter of every course, and a projector for every classroom, likewise, 40 rooms per building, totaling 120 projectors for classrooms across 3 buildings. Additionally, every student has their own office chair, a LAN port, and 2 charging sockets. I was amazed by the way they built the infrastructure. Every day we check the online notice board (ONB) for updates, and we have an E-portal where they post all kinds of newspapers daily. It didn't end there, we wrote our final exams of the semester online. Yes, there was no question paper, they gave us a secure online jar (java) file for questions and MCQs with a timer at the top, and we were unable to leave until the exam ended. I feel, It's a blessing for me to have gotten into RGUKT.

We had fun in the English and math classes, where we used to participate in activities and sometimes the professor would ask questions to specific individuals. That was a nightmare if you didn't know the answer, because the entire class would look at you. But chill, no one is perfect here; we are here to learn. The funny part is in the chemistry labs, when the lab assistant wasn't around, we used to mix different liquids and experiment with them. It was a bit scary, but we did it for fun.

Coming to Physical training (PT), It was a bit of a nightmare for us. Everyone should attend morning PT without fail. PT sir would often visit our rooms, and we would rush to the playground straight from bed, sometimes without a shirt!

And I can't forget the last day study struggles before mid exams usually involving group study sessions. My friend Paul used to explain things to me during these sessions.Important thing I forgot to mention that is "I'm a back-bencher". We used to watch movies during boring lectures and funny discussions. Anyway, we completed our first year with a lot of fun and memories. Only 5 more years to become an engineer!
