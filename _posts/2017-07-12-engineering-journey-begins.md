Hello, I am Kranthi Kumar. I wrote another <a href="https://kranthikvrm.github.io/posts/my-first-year-at-RGUKT-Nuzvid">blog post</a> before this explaining how I started and ended my first year of intermediate college. While writing this post, I had completed my 12th grade. Before getting into the engineering topic, I will discuss how my 12th grade was and what motivated me to choose computer science.

So, after my first year at RGUKT Nuzvid, I got a clarity on things happening around me. The second year was much like the first, with not much to share, but this is the year when students make their final decision on which stream they want to pursue. In my college, there are six streams: computer science and engineering (CSE), mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, electronics and electrical engineering, civil engineering, and metallurgical and materials engineering.

From the beginning, I was interested in pursuing a career in mechanical engineering. However, this 12th grade changed my interest to CSE.

At the beginning of the 12th-grade semester-1, we had a course named web development, where they taught HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript codes, and in semester-2, we had a basic Python course, where I learned basic syntax, applying logics, printing patterns, just basics.

Learning web development and Python made me excited about the CSE field. With that excitement, I created a website for my class, installed Xampp server, hosted it, but nothing went really well. I also tried downloading Facebook-like social site templates and tried hosting them, but yeah, without much knowledge, I ended up with the file on my computer. At least I tried.

So that's how I figured out on my own that I am going to take CSE.

In the beginning of the engineering (Bachelor of Technology - CSE), it's all the same as 11th, many new faces into one class, new people into the network. Fortunately, I knew 1/3 of class members. Coming to the 1st year of BTech, I had courses in Data Structures, C programming, Database management, and many more. It was overwhelming for us to learn all the new stuff, not only for me, but many of my friends felt the same. It was hard to manage time. But these situations taught us time management.

And the fun with friends, learning stuff, playing cricket, going for an outing (out of campus) with all these, we ended our 1st year of BTech.

Thank you for reading my boring story üòÅ
