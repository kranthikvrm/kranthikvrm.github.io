Thanksgiving is a time for food, family, and moments of gratitude. But as you navigate through turkey dinners and awkward small talk with relatives, have you ever noticed how much this holiday has in common with cybersecurity? It might sound strange, but protecting your data and surviving Thanksgiving both require preparation, awareness, and handling the unexpected.

Let’s take a look at how Thanksgiving traditions can teach us about staying safe online.

## Grandma’s House Rules = Your Firewall

At Thanksgiving, Grandma lays down the law “No politics at the table!” This is her way of keeping harmony during dinner. Similarly, a firewall blocks anything disruptive from entering your digital space. Just as Grandma’s rule keeps the meal civil, a firewall ensures your system stays safe from harmful traffic.

## Cybersecurity training is explaining the rules to new guests

First-time Thanksgiving guests need a crash course in family traditions like no phones at the table, pie before politics, and the correct way to pass the gravy. Cybersecurity training serves a similar purpose. New employees or family members need clear guidance to avoid costly mistakes.

## Uncle Bob = Spam email

Uncle Bob always shows up with unsolicited advice or tall tales that no one asked for. Sound familiar? He’s the human equivalent of spam email like intrusive, annoying, and best ignored. Just like you filter out spam, sometimes you need to nod and politely tune him out.

## Phishing scams are Aunt Mary’s Too-Good-To-Be-True stories

Aunt Mary swears she met a celebrity in the grocery store, but her story doesn’t quite add up. Phishing scams also seem exciting “You’ve won a $500 gift card!” but a closer look reveals the truth. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

## Family seating chart = Access controls

A carefully planned seating chart avoids drama by keeping clashing personalities apart. Similarly, access controls in cybersecurity ensure that only the right people have access to sensitive information. Both are essential to keeping things peaceful and secure.

## The “Did You Make This?” test is like checking HTTPS

When someone brings a dish to Thanksgiving, you always ask, “Did you make this?” because you need to know if it’s trustworthy. In the digital world, this is like checking if a website has HTTPS. If it doesn’t have that reassuring little lock icon, proceed with caution.

## Someone ate all the pie = A data breach

You’ve been eyeing that pie all night, only to find out someone beat you to it. A data breach feels just as devastating, valuable resources stolen before you even got the chance to enjoy them. Protect your data (and your desserts) to avoid disappointment.

## Malware is the cousin who brings nothing and takes everything

We all know that one cousin who shows up empty handed, piles their plate high, and then “takes a little extra for later.” Malware operates in much the same way. It sneaks in unnoticed, drains your resources, and leaves chaos in its wake. Maybe it’s time to stop letting them in.

## Gratitude = The best defense

Finally, Thanksgiving is a time for gratitude, and cybersecurity deserves a little thanks too. Appreciate the IT professionals, antivirus software, and best practices that keep your digital life secure. And while you’re at it, thank yourself for being watchful, whether it’s protecting your data or guarding your slice of pumpkin pie.
