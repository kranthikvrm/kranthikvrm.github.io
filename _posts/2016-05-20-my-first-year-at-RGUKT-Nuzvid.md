Hey, hi buddy! I'm Kranthi Kumar, and this is my very first blog post, so go easy on me if you find any mistakes. To start with, I completed my 10th grade in my village Kesavaram and got a seat at RGUKT Nuzvid for a 6-year integrated program covering 11th, 12th, and Engineering. I'm writing this post at the end of my first year at RGUKT. I've just started my journey here at RGUKT (IIIT Nuzvid), surrounded by new faces and big buildings, everything is fresh and exciting. I've made new friends and they are from different parts of the state, That's interesting! 

Before coming here, I was only familiar with my beloved "Godavari accent", but at RGUKT, I saw people speaking with various Telugu accents, which was quite surprising for me. Most students here come from rural backgrounds, just like me and it took me about 2-3 months to form strong bonds with these new friends.

One of the great things about RGUKT is that every student receives a laptop, they can use until graduation. pretty awesome, right? While I wasn't particularly excited about receiving a laptop from the college (since I already had one from my 10th grade), I could see the happiness on my fellow students faces ðŸ¤©. Now, about the education, English classes were scary and fun at the same time, I have a partner named Anil with whom I participated in class activities. He used to put me in trouble by asking questions in front of everyone, which made me mumble a lot, as English is not our first language. 

In the chemistry labs, when the lab assistant wasn't around, we used to mix different liquids and experimented with them, it was a bit scary, but we did it. Coming to Physical training (PT), It was a bit of a nightmare for us. Everyone should attend morning PT without fail. PT sir would often visit our rooms, and we would rush to the playground straight from bed, sometimes without a shirt!

And I can't forget the last day study struggles before mid exams (We named it "one day batting" as we only open books a day before exams) usually involving group study sessions. My friend Paul used to explain things to me during these sessions.Important detail I forgot to mentionâ€”I'm a back-bencher. We used to watch movies during boring lectures. Anyway, we completed our first year with a lot of fun and memories. Only 5 more years to become an engineer!
