Hello buddy, I am Kranthi Kumar. In this blog post, I will share about a cyber-competition in my penetration testing course. During my next to last semester, I took a Penetration Testing course as part of my cybersecurity master's program. I performed well in the course, and Professor "Hwee-Joo Kam" consistently encouraged us to participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

Throughout the course, she taught us various skills, starting from basic Linux skills, reconnaissance, to different OSINT tools such as Shodan, theHarvester, whatweb, and amass for enumeration. Additionally, we learned about running port scans with Metasploit, tcpdump, and many other tools.

At the end of the course, we had a cyber competition where the class members were divided into teams. I was placed in the blue team along with two others. Professor "Hwee-Joo Kam" assigned us a red team and Windows host through AWS EC2 instances for both teams. It was an exciting experience as we gained real-time exposure to defending against attackers.

Although the setup favored the Red team with ample resources, I endeavored to protect our systems from their attacks. Please refer to the attached report for more details.

Thank you for being here ❤️
