### it's disk so i opened it with MagnetAxiom 
### in the challenge he said that ```An employee downloaded an unauthorized app``` so we will look for browser history 
![gamer1.0](gamer1.0.png)

### so we look we found that there is suspicous .rar file downloaded from disord we know that it's name is ```appmanifest.rar``` so let's search about it in disk ```find . -name "appmanifest*"``` 
![gamer1.1](gamer1.1.png)

### so we found it let's calculate it's hash  ``` sha256sum appmanifest (1).rar``` we found ```e29f365335adeea575ae1e592bd50313c38bd89bf9ff6b7f7f06e6377b0661c3``` now upload it to virus total to see it's have malware or not

### so we know know that it's malicious and we got cve of it ```cve-2023-38831``` now we know that this is attacker sent it in discord and it have malware we will analyze it later
### now we need to analyze discord cache file [this link helped me](https://abrignoni.blogspot.com/2018/03/finding-discord-app-chats-in-windows.html) so i downloaded this [tool](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html) and i opened cache file in this program and extract all files by click ```ctr a and then press f4```  and then i opened ```50.json``` file 
![gamer1.3](gamer1.3.png)

### now we know that t4r3kk who sent the malicious .rar file to the victim we need to know create time for this user so we use [this website](https://discord.id/) and put id  ```964399437671710790``` 
![gamer1.4](gamer1.4.png)

### now we know creation date and id and i did some osint i got the real name of attacker

### now here we know sha256 of file and we know the cve we got in first question so now we need to know when this is .rar is installed in the system 
### this is the first time the file is downloaded to system
![gamer2.0](gamer2.0.png)

### and the first time it executed 
![gamer2.1](gamer2.1.png)

### now date_of_execution - date_of_downloading

### ok when we searched about malware with ```find . -name "appmanifest*"``` we found suspicious file 
![gamer4.0](gamer4.0.png)

### so i run this script in the virtual machine windows 
![gamer4.1](gamer4.1.png)

### so from there we got the command and file 
flag: <mark>0xL4ugh{NothingSpecial_C:\T3MP\run.bat}</mark>
