Hey, Hi, I am Kranthi Kumar from India, born and brought up in my village "Kesavaram". I have always had a passion for technology and gadgets. My interest began with using keypad Nokia mobiles, then exploring early Samsung smartphones. With that interest, I was introduced to laptops by my parents when I was in my 10th grade. After my 10th, I went to RGUKT where I completed my 11th, 12th and Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering. During my third year of BTech, I did a penetration testing internship at Meebuddy where I got a chance to explore web application penetration testing and also gained some insight into web development and how things in IT work in real time. So, after completing my BTech, I received an offer from Infosys through campus placement. That's how I joined Infosys as a SOC Analyst. At Infosys, I learned more about corporate culture, and working in SOC is not an easy task but rewarding. You will love SOC if you have an investigative mind. After working as a SOC Analyst for one year and two months or so, I left Infosys to pursue my master's in cybersecurity at the University of Tampa (UT). Here at UT, I enhanced my skills in different areas and also participated in a few Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions with my teammates. Additionally, I completed courses and challenges on platforms like Tryhackme and Letsdefend.

I will be graduating in May 2024, and I am actively looking for cybersecurity roles. If you have any opportunities available or would like to discuss further, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
