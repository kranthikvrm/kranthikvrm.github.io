Hey, I am Kranthi Kumar from India. I completed my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering. During my third year of BTech, I did a penetration testing internship at Meebuddy. After completing my BTech, I joined Infosys as a SOC Analyst. After one year and two months with Infosys, I decided to pursue my master's in cybersecurity at the University of Tampa. Here, I enhanced my skills and participated in a few Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Additionally, I completed courses and challenges on platforms like Tryhackme and Letsdefend.

I will be graduating in May 2024, and I am actively looking for cybersecurity roles. If you have any opportunities available or would like to discuss further, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
